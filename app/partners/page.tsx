          <h2>Our approach to marketing</h2>
          <p>
            Marketing practices are a vital part of business, allowing it to
            grow, promote its services, and stay in touch with the audience.
            They are carried out in several forms, such as the mailout of
            advertisements, newsletters, important notifications, news and other
            promotional materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            To deliver all these communications, we may use the following tools:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Email messages;</li>
            <li>Letters sent by post;</li>
            <li>Phone and cell-phone calls;</li>
            <li>SMS texts;</li>
            <li>
              Messages in any other media you specified while signing up.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Please note that we have the right to share some of your
            information with our third-party partners. As a result, our
            partners may also send you their promotional materials using all the
            contacts you&apos;ve provided us with.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as you start using <strong>RobotLoans</strong>, you
            acknowledge that you are aware of our marketing practices and that
            you agree to receive messages from us and our third-party partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you feel overwhelmed with correspondence, you can always use the
            option to <strong>unsubscribe</strong> from us.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we need to state that we are not liable for the messages
            our partners may send you and that you need to reach out to them if
            you have any questions regarding their marketing practices. You will
            also have to contact them directly if you want to unsubscribe from
            their correspondence.
